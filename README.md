# mentorship

* the name helps us as it's not overwhelming
* people like the word mentorship and would be fine with some guidance
* career / coaching / teaching - these are strong words

* connect students with our mentors
* computer science, finance, 

* mentorship is needed man
* I never knew what to do, where to find the things and I didn't know who to pay
* for example, I came in college, how to study, manage finances maybe?
* look for internships maybe?
* can I have a headstart?
* other students help, but not that much, 
* college resources are not the best

* mobile app is not the best for this
* this can be a chatting service where we chat with mentors
* find mentors, chat with them. we can start this with 5 people for now and just a fucking chatting service
